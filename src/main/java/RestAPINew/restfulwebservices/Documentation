Social Media Application - resources and Methods

Users REST API
-GET/users

Create a User
-POST/users

Retrieve one User
-GET/Users/{id}->/Users/1 (here we are using a path variable)

DELETE a User
-DELETE/users/{id}->/users/1

Posts(Social media post) REST PI
Retrieve  all posts for a User
-GET/users/{id}/posts

Create a post for a user
-POST/users/{id}/posts

Retrieve details of a post
-GET/users/{id}/posts/{post_id}



All the variables that are declared in User.java and upon creating Constructors, setters and getters ,toString() -> this whole thing is called a "JAVA BEAN".
Now we can build a RESTAPI around the above created User Bean.

To play with data stored in a database we need to create a DAO object(Data Access Object).
